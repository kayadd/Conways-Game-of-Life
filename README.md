# Conways-Game-of-Life
Implementing Conways Game of Life in HTML with Javascript and CSS. This is also a 
project because im bored. Uni is starting in a month for me and I need something to do, so
here we are. Im still working on it and it is far from perfect, but my plan is to fully
implement Conways Game of Life and some standard configurations, like the glider and
explan the history of it.
